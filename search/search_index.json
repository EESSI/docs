E.g. <code>2024.05.06-eb-4.9.1-CUDA-12.1.1-ship-full-runtime.yml</code> was added in a PR on the 6th of May 2024 and used to rebuild CUDA-12.1.1 using EasyBuild 4.9.1 to resolve an issue with some runtime libraries missing from the initial CUDA 12.1.1 installation.</p> <p>At the top of your easystack file, please use comments to include a short description, and make sure to include any relevant links to related issues (e.g. from the GitHub repositories of EESSI, EasyBuild, or the software you are rebuilding).</p> <p>As an example, consider the full easystack file (<code>2024.05.06-eb-4.9.1-CUDA-12.1.1-ship-full-runtime.yml</code>) used for the aforementioned CUDA rebuild: </p> <pre><code># 2024.05.06\n# Original matching of files we could ship was not done correctly.

is to build a common stack of scientific software installations for HPC systems and beyond, including laptops, personal workstations and cloud infrastructure. This module allows you to extend EESSI using the same configuration for EasyBuild as EESSI itself uses. A number of environment variables control the behaviour of the module: - EESSI_USER_INSTALL can be set to a location to install modules for use by   the user only. The location must already exist on the filesystem. - EESSI_PROJECT_INSTALL can be set to a location to install modules for use by   a project. The location must already exist on the filesystem and you should   ensure that the location has the correct Linux group and the SGID permission   is set on that directory (<code>chmod g+s $EESSI_PROJECT_INSTALL</code>) so that all   members of the group have permission to read and write installations. - EESSI_SITE_INSTALL is either defined or not and cannot be used with another   environment variable. A site installation is done in a defined location and   any installations there are (by default) world readable. - EESSI_CVMFS_INSTALL is either defined or not and cannot be used with another   environment variable. A CVMFS installation targets a defined location which   will be ingested into CVMFS and is only useful for CVMFS administrators. - If none of the environment variables above are defined, an EESSI_USER_INSTALL   is assumed with a value of $HOME/EESSI If both EESSI_USER_INSTALL and EESSI_PROJECT_INSTALL are defined, both sets of installations are exposed, but new installations are created as user installations.</p> <p>https://eessi.io/docs/</p>"},{"location":"available_software/detail/EESSI-extend/#available-modules","title":"Available modules","text":"<p>The overview below shows which

In addition, solvated systems with atomistic resolution typically have a large excess of solvent atoms compared to solute atoms, thus Lennard-Jones interactions tend to account for a large portion of the simulation time.

This was solved with a patch file committed to the EasyBuild easyconfigs repository, that modifies both <code>configure</code> and <code>config/macros.m4</code> to make <code>binutils</code> detection more robust. This patch was also provided to Extrae developers to incorporate into future releases.</p> <p>The next step was to submit a Pull Request to the EasyBuild easyblocks repository with some modifications to the <code>extrae.py</code> easyblock that:</p> <ul> <li>Removed configure options <code>--enable-xml</code> and <code>--with-dwarf</code> that were no longer available in Extrae starting from v4.1.0.</li> <li>Added <code>--with-xml</code> option to specify <code>libxml2</code> root dir.</li> <li>Added <code>--enable-posix-clock</code> configure option for RISCV64 (needed to build Extrae as no lower level clock seems to be available yet in RISC-V architectures).</li> </ul> <p>With all of this in place, we managed to correctly build Extrae but found out that many tests failed to pass, including all 21 under the MPI directory.

We submitted a Pull Request to the Extrae repository with the bugfix that has been already merged and incorporated into new releases.</p> <p>Regarding the second one, it was reported to Extrae developers as an issue. They suggested commenting out a call at <code>src/tracer/wrappers/pthread/pthread_wrapper.c</code> at line 240: <code>//Backend_Flush_pThread (pthread_self());</code>. We reported that this fixed the issue so this change has also been incorporated into the Extrae main branch for future releases.</p> <p>The last failing test was an issue related with the access to HW counters on the building/testing system. The problem was that the test assumed that Extrae (through PAPI) can access HW counters (in this case, <code>PAPI_TOT_INS</code>). This might not be the case because this is very system-dependent (since it involves permissions, etc). As a solution, we committed a patch to the Extrae repository which ensured that the test will not fail if <code>PAPI_TOT_CYC</code> is unavailable in the testing system. As this has not been incorporated yet into the Extrae repository, we also committed a patch file to the EasyBuild easyconfigs repository that solves the problem with this specific test but also with others that suffered from this same issue.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/26/extrae-now-available-in-EESSI/#finally-version-420","title":"Finally, version 4.2.0","text":"<p>Due to the bugfixes mentioned in previous section that were incorporated into the Extrae repository, we switched again to an updated version of Extrae (in this case v4.2.0).

This is because <code>sf</code> requires system packages <code>libgdal-dev</code> and <code>libproj-dev</code>, which would add yet another step, complicating our CI workflow. Thankfully, EESSI makes a lot of the packages dependencies available to us from the start, as well as a fully functioning version of R, and the necessary package dependencies to boot! As far as setup goes, this results in a simple CI workflow:</p> <pre><code>include:\n  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/eessi/gitlab-eessi/eessi@1.0.5\n\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - msx_map.png\n  script:\n    # Create directory for personal R library\n    - mkdir $CI_BUILDS_DIR/R\n    - export R_LIBS_USER=$CI_BUILDS_DIR/R\n    # Load the R module from EESSI\n    - module load R-bundle-CRAN/2023.12-foss-2023a\n    # Install eessirmaps, the rnaturalearth dep and create the plot\n    - R -e \"install.packages('rnaturalearthdata', repos = 'https://cran.rstudio.com/');\n      remotes::install_gitlab('neves-p/eessirmaps', upgrade = FALSE);\n      eessirmaps::multixscale_map(); ggplot2::ggsave('msx_map.png', bg = 'white')\"\n</code></pre> <p>Note how we simply include the EESSI GitLab CI component and set up a blank directory for our user R libraries. Remember, because of EESSI, the environment that you develop in will be exactly the same as the one the CI is run in. Apart from the <code>rnaturalearthdata</code> R package, all the other dependencies are taken care of by the <code>R-bundle-CRAN/2023.12-foss-2023a</code> EESSI module. This is true for the system and R package dependencies.</p> <p>Then we simply have to install our package to the CI environment and call the <code>multixscale_map()</code> function to produce the plot, which is uploaded as an artifact from the CI environment.

In order to ensure the stability and security of the EESSI Stratum 0 server, it has a strict firewall, and only the EESSI-maintained public Stratum 1 servers are allowed to replicate from it. However, EESSI provides a synchronisation server that can be used for setting up private Stratum 1 replica servers, and this is available at <code>http://aws-eu-west-s1-sync.eessi.science</code>.</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>In the past we have seen a few occurrences of data transfer issues when files were being pulled in by or from a Stratum 1 server. In such cases the <code>cvmfs_server snapshot</code> command, used for synchronizing the Stratum 1, may break with errors like <code>failed to download &lt;URL to file&gt;</code>. Trying to manually download the mentioned file with <code>curl</code> will also not work, and result in errors like: <pre><code>curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer\n</code></pre> In all cases this was due to an intrusion prevention system scanning the associated network, and hence scanning all files going in or out of the Stratum 1. Though it was a false-positive in all cases, this breaks the synchronization procedure of your Stratum 1. If this is the case, you can try switching to HTTPS by using <code>https://aws-eu-west-s1-sync.eessi.science</code> for synchronizing your Stratum 1. Even though there is no advantage for CVMFS itself in using HTTPS (it has built-in mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of the data), this will prevent the described issues, as the intrusion prevention system will not be able to inspect the encrypted data. However, not only does HTTPS introduce some overhead due to the encryption/decryption, it also makes caching in forward proxies impossible. Therefore, it is strongly discouraged to use HTTPS as default.</p>"},{"location":"filesystem_layer/stratum1/#manual-configuration","title":"Manual configuration","text":"<p>In order to set up a Stratum 1 manually, you can make use of the instructions in the Private Stratum 1 replica server section of the MultiXscale tutorial \"Best Practices for CernVM-FS in HPC\".</p>"},{"location":"filesystem_layer/stratum1/#configuration-using-ansible","title":"Configuration using Ansible","text":"<p>The recommended way for setting up an EESSI Stratum 1 is by running the Ansible playbook <code>stratum1.yml</code> from the filesystem-layer repository on GitHub.

In this case, they will just connect to your local Stratum 1 by default.</p> <p>If you do want to set up the GEO API, you can find more information on how to (freely) obtain this key in the CVMFS documentation: https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-replica.html#geo-api-setup.</p> <p>You can put your license key in the local configuration file <code>inventory/local_site_specific_vars.yml</code> with the variables <code>cvmfs_geo_license_key</code> and <code>cvmfs_geo_account_id</code>.</p> <p>Start by installing Ansible, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>sudo yum install -y ansible\n</code></pre> <p>Then install Ansible roles for EESSI:</p> <pre><code>ansible-galaxy role install -r ./requirements.yml --force\n</code></pre> <p>Make sure you have enough space in <code>/srv</code> on the Stratum 1, since the snapshots of the repositories will end up there by default.

Here, as an example, we will define a <code>load</code> hook that environment variable <code>MY_ENV_VAR</code> to <code>1</code> whenever an <code>OpenMPI</code> module is loaded.</p> <p>First, you typically want to load the necessary Lua packages: <pre><code>-- $EESSI_CVMFS_REPO/host_injections/$EESSI_VERSION/.lmod/SitePackage.lua\n\n-- The Strict package checks for the use of undeclared variables:\nrequire(\"strict\")\n\n-- Load the Lmod Hook package\nlocal hook=require(\"Hook\")\n</code></pre></p> <p>Next, we define a function that we want to use as a hook.

We recommend setting the <code>$RFM_PREFIX</code> environment variable rather than specifying <code>prefix</code> in   your configuration file, so our common logging configuration can pick up on it   (see also <code>$RFM_PREFIX</code>).</li> <li><code>stagedir</code>: A shared directory that is available on all nodes that will execute ReFrame tests. This is used for storing (temporary) files related to the test. Typically, you want to set this to a path on a (shared) scratch filesystem. Defining this is optional: the default is a '<code>stage</code>' directory inside the <code>prefix</code> directory.</li> <li><code>partitions</code>: Details on system partitions, see below.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"test-suite/ReFrame-configuration-file/#partitions","title":"System partitions (<code>systems.partitions</code>)","text":"<p>The next step is to add the system partitions to the configuration files, which is also specified as a Python list since a system can have multiple partitions.</p> <p>The <code>partitions</code> section of the configuration for a system with two Slurm partitions (one CPU partition, and one GPU partition) could for example look something like this:</p> <pre><code>site_configuration = {\n    'systems': [\n        {\n            ...\n            'partitions': [\n                {\n                    'name': 'cpu_partition',\n                    'descr': 'CPU partition'\n                    'scheduler': 'slurm',\n                    'prepare_cmds': ['source %s' % common_eessi_init()],\n                    'launcher': 'mpirun',\n                    'access':  ['-p cpu'],\n                    'environs': ['default'],\n                    'max_jobs': 4,\n                    'features': [\n                        FEATURES[CPU]\n                    ] + list(SCALES.keys()),\n                },\n                {\n                    'name': 'gpu_partition',\n                    'descr': 'GPU partition'\n                    'scheduler': 'slurm',\n                    'prepare_cmds': ['source %s' % common_eessi_init()],\n                    'launcher': 'mpirun',\n                    'access':  ['-p gpu'],\n                    'environs': ['default'],\n                    'max_jobs': 4,\n                    'resources': [\n                        {\n                            'name': '_rfm_gpu',\n                            'options': ['--gpus-per-node={num_gpus_per_node}'],\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    'devices': [\n                        {\n                            'type': DEVICE_TYPES[GPU],\n                            'num_devices': 4,\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    'features': [\n                        FEATURES[CPU],\n                        FEATURES[GPU],\n                    ],\n                    'extras': {\n                        GPU_VENDOR: GPU_VENDORS[NVIDIA],\n                    },\n                },\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The most common configuration items defined at this level are:</p> <ul> <li><code>name</code>:   The name of the partition. Pick anything you like.</li> <li><code>descr</code>:   Description of the partition. Again, pick whatever you like.</li> <li><code>scheduler</code>:   The scheduler used to submit to this partition, for example <code>slurm</code>. All valid options can be found   in the ReFrame documentation.</li> <li><code>launcher</code>:   The parallel launcher used on this partition, for example <code>mpirun</code> or <code>srun</code>. All valid options can be found   in the ReFrame documentation.</li> <li><code>access</code>:   A list of arguments that you would normally pass to the scheduler when submitting to this partition   (for example '<code>-p cpu</code>' for submitting to a Slurm partition called <code>cpu</code>).   If supported by your scheduler, we recommend to not export the submission environment   (for example by using '<code>--export=None</code>' with Slurm). This avoids test failures due to environment variables set   in the submission environment that are passed down to submitted jobs.</li> <li><code>prepare_cmds</code>:   Commands to execute at the start of every job that runs a test. If your batch scheduler does not export   the environment of the submit host, this is typically where you can initialize the EESSI environment.</li> <li><code>environs</code>:   The names of the programming environments (to be defined later in the configuration file via <code>environments</code>)   that may be used on this partition. A programming environment is required for tests that are compiled first,   before they can run. The EESSI test suite however only tests existing software installations, so no compilation   (or specific programming environment) is needed. Simply specify <code>'environs': ['default']</code>,   since ReFrame requires that a default environment is defined. </li> <li><code>max_jobs</code>:   The maximum amount of jobs ReFrame is allowed to submit in parallel. Some batch systems limit how many jobs users   are allowed to have in the queue. You can use this to make sure ReFrame doesn't exceed that limit.</li> <li><code>resources</code>:   This field defines how additional resources can be requested in a batch job. Specifically, on a GPU partition,   you have to define a resource with the name '<code>_rfm_gpu</code>'. The <code>options</code> field should then contain the argument to be   passed to the batch scheduler in order to request a certain number of GPUs per node, which could be different for   different batch schedulers. For example, when using Slurm you would specify:   <pre><code>'resources': [\n  {\n      'name': '_rfm_gpu',\n      'options': ['--gpus-per-node={num_gpus_per_node}'],\n  },\n],\n</code></pre></li> <li><code>processor</code>:   We recommend to NOT define this field, unless CPU autodetection is not working for you.   The EESSI test suite relies on information about your processor topology to run. Using CPU autodetection is the   easiest way to ensure that all processor-related information needed by the EESSI test suite are defined.   Only if CPU autodetection is failing for you do we advice you to set the <code>processor</code> in the partition configuration   as an alternative. Although additional fields might be used by future EESSI tests, at this point you'll have to   specify at least the following fields:   <pre><code>'processor': {\n    'num_cpus': 64,  # Total number of CPU cores in a node\n    'num_sockets': 2,  # Number of sockets in a node\n    'num_cpus_per_socket': 32,  # Number of CPU cores per socket\n    'num_cpus_per_core': 1,  # Number of hardware threads per CPU core\n}                 \n</code></pre></li> <li><code>features</code>:   The <code>features</code> field is used by the EESSI test suite to run tests only on a partition if it supports a certain   feature (for example if GPUs are available). Feature names are standardized in the EESSI test suite in   <code>eessi.testsuite.constants.FEATURES</code>   dictionary.   Typically, you want to define <code>features: [FEATURES[CPU]] + list(SCALES.keys())</code> for CPU based partitions, and   <code>features: [FEATURES[GPU]] + list(SCALES.keys())</code> for GPU based partitions. The first tells the EESSI test suite   that this partition can only run CPU-based tests, whereas second indicates that this partition can only run GPU-based   tests. You can define a single partition to have both the CPU and GPU features (since <code>features</code> is a Python list).   However, since the CPU-based tests will not ask your batch scheduler for GPU resources, this may fail on batch   systems that force you to ask for at least one GPU on GPU-based nodes. Also, running CPU-only code on a GPU node is   typically considered bad practice, thus testing its functionality is typically not relevant.   The <code>list(SCALES.keys())</code> adds all the scales that may be used by EESSI tests to the <code>features</code> list. These scales are   defined in   <code>eessi.testsuite.constants.SCALES</code>   and define at which scales tests should be run, e.g. single core, half a node, a full node, two nodes, etc. This   can be used to exclude running at certain scales on systems that would not support it. E.g. some systems might not   support requesting multiple partial nodes, which is what the <code>1cpn_2nodes</code> (1 core per node, on two nodes) and   <code>1cpn_4nodes</code> scales do. One could exclude these by setting e.g.   <code>features: [FEATURES[CPU]] + [s for s in SCALES if s not in ['1cpn_2nodes', '1cpn_4nodes']]</code>. With this   configuration setting, ReFrame will run all the scales listed in `eessi.testsuite.constants.SCALES except   those two. In a similar way, one could exclude all multinode tests if one just has a single node available.</li> <li><code>devices</code>: This field specifies information on devices (for example) present in the partition. Device types are standardized in the EESSI test suite in the <code>eessi.testsuite.constants.DEVICE_TYPES</code> dictionary. This is used by the EESSI test suite to determine how many of these devices it can/should use per node.   Typically, there is no need to define <code>devices</code> for CPU partitions.   For GPU partitions, you want to define something like:   <pre><code>'devices': {\n    'type': DEVICE_TYPES[GPU],\n    'num_devices': 4,  # or however many GPUs you have per node\n}\n</code></pre></li> <li><code>extras</code>: This field specifies extra information on the partition, such as the GPU vendor. Valid fields for <code>extras</code> are standardized as constants in <code>eessi.testsuite.constants</code> (for example <code>GPU_VENDOR</code>). This is used by the EESSI test suite to decide if a partition can run a test that specifically requires a certain brand of GPU.   Typically, there is no need to define <code>extras</code> for CPU partitions.   For GPU partitions, you typically want to specify the GPU vendor, for example:   <pre><code>'extras': {\n    GPU_VENDOR: GPU_VENDORS[NVIDIA]\n}\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Note that as more tests are added to the EESSI test suite, the use of <code>features</code>, <code>devices</code> and <code>extras</code> by the EESSI test suite may be extended, which may require an update of your configuration file to define newly recognized fields.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Keep in mind that ReFrame partitions are virtual entities: they may or may not correspond to a partition as it is configured in your batch system. One might for example have a single partition in the batch system, but configure it as two separate partitions in the ReFrame configuration file based on additional constraints that are passed to the scheduler, see for example the AWS CitC example configuration.</p> <p>The EESSI test suite (and more generally, ReFrame) assumes the hardware within a partition defined in the ReFrame configuration file is homogeneous.</p>"},{"location":"test-suite/ReFrame-configuration-file/#environments","title":"Environments","text":"<p>ReFrame needs a programming environment to be defined in its configuration file for tests that need to be compiled before they are run.

Typically, ReFrame tests hardcode system specific information (core counts, performance references, etc) in the test definition. The EESSI test suite aims to be portable, and implements a mixin class that invokes a series of standard hooks to replace information that is typically hardcoded. All system-specific information is then limited to the ReFrame configuration file. As an example: rather than hardcoding that a test should run with 128 tasks (i.e. because a system has 128 core nodes), the EESSI test suite has a hook that can define a test should be run on a \"single, full node\". The hook queries the ReFrame configuration file for the amount of cores per node, and specifies this number as the corresponding amount of tasks. Thus, on a 64-core node, this test would run with 64 tasks, while on a 128-core node, it would run 128 tasks.</p>"},{"location":"test-suite/writing-portable-tests/#test-requirements","title":"Test requirements","text":"<p>To be useful in the aforementioned scenarios, tests need to satisfy a number of requirements. </p> <ul> <li>Tests are implemented in the ReFrame HPC testing framework.</li> <li>Multiple tests may be implemented for a single software package.</li> <li>Tests should run in a reasonable amount of time (less than 1 hour) for all the scales for which it is defined to be valid (on a recent CPU/GPU).</li> <li>There should be at least one light-weight (short, low-core, low-memory) test case.

However, we can set it to match any system:</p> <pre><code>valid_systems = [*]\n</code></pre> <p>Normally, <code>valid_systems</code> is used as a way of guaranteeing that a system has the necessary properties to run the test. For example, if we know that <code>my_gpu_system</code> has NVIDIA GPUs and I have a test written for NVIDIA GPUs, I would specify <code>valid_systems['my_gpu_system']</code> for that test. This, however, is a surrogate for declaring what my test needs: I'm saying it needs <code>my_gpu_system</code>, while in fact I could make the more general statement 'this test needs NVIDIA GPUs'.</p> <p>To keep the test system-agnostic we can declare what the test needs by using ReFrame's concept of partition <code>features</code> (a string) and/or <code>extras</code> (a key-value pair); see the ReFrame documentation on <code>valid_systems</code>. For example, a test could declare it needs the <code>gpu</code> feature. Such a test will only be created by ReFrame for partitions that declare (in the ReFrame configuration file) that they have the <code>gpu</code> feature.</p> <p>Since <code>features</code> and <code>extras</code> are full text fields, we standardize those in the EESSI test suite in the <code>eessi/testsuite/constants.py</code> file. For example, tests that require an NVIDIA GPU could specify</p> <pre><code>from eessi.testsuite.constants import FEATURES, GPU, GPU_VENDOR, GPU_VENDORS, NVIDIA\n...\nvalid_systems = f'+{FEATURES[GPU]} %{GPU_VENDOR}={GPU_VENDORS[NVIDIA]}'\n</code></pre> <p>which makes sure that a test instance is only generated for partitions (as defined in the ReFrame configuration file) that specify that they have the corresponding feature and extras:</p> <pre><code>from eessi.testsuite.constants import FEATURES, GPU, GPU_VENDOR, GPU_VENDORS, NVIDIA\n...\n'features': [\n     FEATURES[GPU],\n],\n'extras': {\n    GPU_VENDOR: GPU_VENDORS[NVIDIA],\n},\n</code></pre> <p>In practice, one will rarely hard-code this <code>valid_systems</code> string. Instead, we have a hook <code>filter_valid_systems_by_device_type</code>. It does the above, and a bit more: it also checks if the module that the test is generated for is CUDA-enabled (in case of a test for <code>NVIDIA</code> GPUs), and only then will it generate a GPU-based test. Calling this hook is mandatory for all tests (even if just to declare they need a CPU to run).</p> <p>Another aspect is that not all ReFrame partitions may be able to run tests of all of the standard <code>SCALES</code>. Each ReFrame partition must add the subset of <code>SCALES</code> it supports to its list of features.  A test case can declare it needs a certain scale. For example, a test case using the <code>16_nodes</code> scale needs a partition with at least 16 nodes. The <code>filter_supported_scales</code> hook then filters out all partitions that do not support running jobs on 16 nodes.

If we wanted to do really well, we could define a linear function (with offset) and fit it through the data (and round up to be on the safe side, i.e. make sure there is enough memory). Then, we could call the hook like this:</p> <pre><code>@run_after('setup')\ndef request_mem(self):\n    mem_required = self.num_tasks_per_node * mem_slope + mem_intercept\n    hooks.req_memory_per_node(self, app_mem_req=mem_required)\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, however, the memory consumption per process is low enough that we don't have go through that effort, and generously request 256 MiB per task that is launched on a node. Thus, we call our hook using:</p> <p><pre><code>@run_after('setup')\ndef request_mem(self):\n    mem_required = self.num_tasks_per_node * 256\n    hooks.req_memory_per_node(self, app_mem_req=mem_required)\n</code></pre> Note that requesting too high an amount of memory means the test will be skipped on nodes that cannot meet that requirement (even if they might have been able to run it without actually running out of memory). Requesting too little will risk nodes running out of memory while running the test. Note that many HPC systems have an amount memory of around 1-2 GB/core. It's good to ensure (if you can) that the memory requests for all valid <code>SCALES</code> for your test do not exceed the total amount of memory available on typical nodes.</p>"},{"location":"test-suite/writing-portable-tests/#requesting-taskprocessthread-binding-recommended","title":"Requesting task/process/thread binding (recommended)","text":"<p>Binding processes to a set of cores prevents the OS from migrating such processes to other cores.

Right now, it is a little convoluted and requires you to have a decent grasp of * What a runtime dynamic linker (<code>ld-linux*.so</code>) is and does * How to influence the behaviour of the runtime linker with <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> * The difference between <code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code></p> <p>As such, this documentation is intended for \"experts\" in the runtime linker and it's behaviour, and most cases are untested.

Since EESSI sets <code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> for all of the modules and the <code>GCC</code> compiler is configured to use the compat layer, there should be no additional configuration required to execute a standard build process. On the other hand, EESSI does not set <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> so, at runtime, the executable will need help finding the libraries that it needs to actually execute. The easiest way to circumvent this requirement is by setting the environment variable <code>LD_RUN_PATH</code> during compile time as well. With <code>LD_RUN_PATH</code> set, the program will be able to tell the dynamic linker to search in those paths when the program is being executed. </p> <p>EESSI uses a compatibility layer to ensure that it takes as few libraries from the host as possible. The safest way to make sure all libraries will point to the required locations in the compatibility layer (and do not leak in from the host operating system) is starting an EESSI prefix shell before building. To do this: </p> <ul> <li>First of all, load the environment by starting an EESSI shell as described here. </li> <li>Load all dependencies you need to build your software. You must use at least a toolchain from EESSI to compile it (<code>foss</code> is a good option as it will also   include MPI with OpenMPI and math libraries via FlexiBLAS/FFTW). </li> <li>Set manually <code>LD_RUN_PATH</code> to resolve libraries at runtime. <code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> should contain all the paths we need, and we also need to include the path to   <code>libstdc++</code> from our GCC installation to avoid picking up the one from the host:   <pre><code>    export LD_RUN_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:$EBROOTGCCCORE/lib64\n</code></pre></li> <li> <p>Compile and make sure the library resolution points to the EESSI stack.
