One holds the container &amp; <code>host_injections</code>, which are (typically) common between multiple PRs and thus you don't have to redownload the container / reinstall the <code>host_injections</code> if you start working on another PR. The other will hold the PR-specific data: a tarball storing the software you'll build in your interactive debugging session.

The host injections will just be picked up from <code>${eessi_common_dir}/host_injections</code> (if those were already installed before). And finally, the <code>--save</code> makes sure that everything that you build in the container gets stored in a tarball as soon as you exit the container.</p> <p>Note that the first <code>exit</code> command will first make you exit the Gentoo prefix environment. Only the second will take you out of the container, and print where the tarball will be stored:</p> <pre><code>[EESSI 2023.06] $ exit\nlogout\nLeaving Gentoo Prefix with exit status 1\nApptainer&gt; exit\nexit\nSaved contents of tmp directory '/tmp/eessi-debug.VgLf1v9gf0' to tarball '${HOME}/pr360/EESSI-1698056784.tgz' (to resume session add '--resume ${HOME}/pr360/EESSI-1698056784.tgz')\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the tarballs can be quite sizeable, so make sure to pick a filesystem where you have a large enough quotum.</p> <p>Next time you want to continue investigating this issue, you can start the container with <code>--resume DIR/TGZ</code> and continue where you left off, having all dependencies already built and available. <pre><code>SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=${eessi_common_dir}/container_cache ./eessi_container.sh --access rw --nvidia all --host-injections ${eessi_common_dir}/host_injections --save ${eessi_pr_dir}/EESSI-1698056784.tgz\n</code></pre></p> <p>For a detailed description on using the script <code>eessi_container.sh</code>, see here.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Reusing a previously downloaded container, or existing CUDA installation from a <code>host_injections</code> is not be a good approach if those could be the cause of your issues.

The location must already exist on the filesystem and you should   ensure that the location has the correct Linux group and the SGID permission   is set on that directory (<code>chmod g+s $EESSI_PROJECT_INSTALL</code>) so that all   members of the group have permission to read and write installations. - EESSI_SITE_INSTALL is either defined or not and cannot be used with another   environment variable. A site installation is done in a defined location and   any installations there are (by default) world readable. - EESSI_CVMFS_INSTALL is either defined or not and cannot be used with another   environment variable.

It is always recommended to have a local caching layer consisting of a few Squid proxies.  If you want to be even better protected against network outages and increase the bandwidth between your cluster nodes and the Stratum 1 servers, you could also consider setting up a local (private) Stratum 1 server that replicates the EESSI CVMFS repository. This guarantees that you always have a full and up-to-date copy of the entire stack available in your local network. </p>"},{"location":"filesystem_layer/stratum1/#requirements-for-a-stratum-1","title":"Requirements for a Stratum 1","text":"<p>The main requirements for a Stratum 1 server are a good network connection to the clients it is going to serve, and sufficient disk space.

In order to ensure the stability and security of the EESSI Stratum 0 server, it has a strict firewall, and only the EESSI-maintained public Stratum 1 servers are allowed to replicate from it. However, EESSI provides a synchronisation server that can be used for setting up private Stratum 1 replica servers, and this is available at <code>http://aws-eu-west-s1-sync.eessi.science</code>.</p> <p>Warn</p> <p>In the past we have seen a few occurrences of data transfer issues when files were being pulled in by or from a Stratum 1 server. In such cases the <code>cvmfs_server snapshot</code> command, used for synchronizing the Stratum 1, may break with errors like <code>failed to download &lt;URL to file&gt;</code>. Trying to manually download the mentioned file with <code>curl</code> will also not work, and result in errors like: <pre><code>curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer\n</code></pre> In all cases this was due to an intrusion prevention system scanning the associated network, and hence scanning all files going in or out of the Stratum 1. Though it was a false-positive in all cases, this breaks the synchronization procedure of your Stratum 1. If this is the case, you can try switching to HTTPS by using <code>https://aws-eu-west-s1-sync.eessi.science</code> for synchronizing your Stratum 1. Even though there is no advantage for CVMFS itself in using HTTPS (it has built-in mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of the data), this will prevent the described issues, as the intrusion prevention system will not be able to inspect the encrypted data. However, not only does HTTPS introduce some overhead due to the encryption/decryption, it also makes caching in forward proxies impossible. Therefore, it is strongly discouraged to use HTTPS as default.</p>"},{"location":"filesystem_layer/stratum1/#manual-configuration","title":"Manual configuration","text":"<p>In order to set up a Stratum 1 manually, you can make use of the instructions in the Private Stratum 1 replica server section of the MultiXscale tutorial \"Best Practices for CernVM-FS in HPC\".</p>"},{"location":"filesystem_layer/stratum1/#configuration-using-ansible","title":"Configuration using Ansible","text":"<p>The recommended way for setting up an EESSI Stratum 1 is by running the Ansible playbook <code>stratum1.yml</code> from the filesystem-layer repository on GitHub.

There is no need to change this,   unless you want to run tests from the EESSI test suite with non-EESSI modules.</li> <li><code>hostnames</code>:   The names of the hosts on which you will run the ReFrame command, as regular expression. Using these names,   ReFrame can automatically determine which of the listed configurations in the <code>systems</code> list to use, which is useful   if you're defining multiple systems in a single configuration file. If you follow our recommendation to limit   yourself to one system per configuration file, simply define <code>'hostnames': ['*']</code>.</li> <li><code>prefix</code>:   Prefix directory for a ReFrame run on this system. Any directories or files produced by ReFrame will use this prefix,   if not specified otherwise.

Pick anything you like.</li> <li><code>descr</code>:   Description of the partition. Again, pick whatever you like.</li> <li><code>scheduler</code>:   The scheduler used to submit to this partition, for example <code>slurm</code>. All valid options can be found   in the ReFrame documentation.</li> <li><code>launcher</code>:   The parallel launcher used on this partition, for example <code>mpirun</code> or <code>srun</code>. All valid options can be found   in the ReFrame documentation.</li> <li><code>access</code>:   A list of arguments that you would normally pass to the scheduler when submitting to this partition   (for example '<code>-p cpu</code>' for submitting to a Slurm partition called <code>cpu</code>).   If supported by your scheduler, we recommend to not export the submission environment   (for example by using '<code>--export=None</code>' with Slurm). This avoids test failures due to environment variables set   in the submission environment that are passed down to submitted jobs.</li> <li><code>prepare_cmds</code>:   Commands to execute at the start of every job that runs a test. If your batch scheduler does not export   the environment of the submit host, this is typically where you can initialize the EESSI environment.</li> <li><code>environs</code>:   The names of the programming environments (to be defined later in the configuration file via <code>environments</code>)   that may be used on this partition. A programming environment is required for tests that are compiled first,   before they can run. The EESSI test suite however only tests existing software installations, so no compilation   (or specific programming environment) is needed. Simply specify <code>'environs': ['default']</code>,   since ReFrame requires that a default environment is defined. </li> <li><code>max_jobs</code>:   The maximum amount of jobs ReFrame is allowed to submit in parallel. Some batch systems limit how many jobs users   are allowed to have in the queue. You can use this to make sure ReFrame doesn't exceed that limit.</li> <li><code>resources</code>:   This field defines how additional resources can be requested in a batch job. Specifically, on a GPU partition,   you have to define a resource with the name '<code>_rfm_gpu</code>'. The <code>options</code> field should then contain the argument to be   passed to the batch scheduler in order to request a certain number of GPUs per node, which could be different for   different batch schedulers. For example, when using Slurm you would specify:   <pre><code>'resources': [\n  {\n      'name': '_rfm_gpu',\n      'options': ['--gpus-per-node={num_gpus_per_node}'],\n  },\n],\n</code></pre></li> <li><code>processor</code>:   We recommend to NOT define this field, unless CPU autodetection is not working for you.   The EESSI test suite relies on information about your processor topology to run. Using CPU autodetection is the   easiest way to ensure that all processor-related information needed by the EESSI test suite are defined.   Only if CPU autodetection is failing for you do we advice you to set the <code>processor</code> in the partition configuration   as an alternative. Although additional fields might be used by future EESSI tests, at this point you'll have to   specify at least the following fields:   <pre><code>'processor': {\n    'num_cpus': 64,  # Total number of CPU cores in a node\n    'num_sockets': 2,  # Number of sockets in a node\n    'num_cpus_per_socket': 32,  # Number of CPU cores per socket\n    'num_cpus_per_core': 1,  # Number of hardware threads per CPU core\n}                 \n</code></pre></li> <li><code>features</code>:   The <code>features</code> field is used by the EESSI test suite to run tests only on a partition if it supports a certain   feature (for example if GPUs are available). Feature names are standardized in the EESSI test suite in   <code>eessi.testsuite.constants.FEATURES</code>   dictionary.   Typically, you want to define <code>features: [FEATURES[CPU]] + list(SCALES.keys())</code> for CPU based partitions, and   <code>features: [FEATURES[GPU]] + list(SCALES.keys())</code> for GPU based partitions. The first tells the EESSI test suite   that this partition can only run CPU-based tests, whereas second indicates that this partition can only run GPU-based   tests. You can define a single partition to have both the CPU and GPU features (since <code>features</code> is a Python list).   However, since the CPU-based tests will not ask your batch scheduler for GPU resources, this may fail on batch   systems that force you to ask for at least one GPU on GPU-based nodes. Also, running CPU-only code on a GPU node is   typically considered bad practice, thus testing its functionality is typically not relevant.   The <code>list(SCALES.keys())</code> adds all the scales that may be used by EESSI tests to the <code>features</code> list. These scales are   defined in   <code>eessi.testsuite.constants.SCALES</code>   and define at which scales tests should be run, e.g. single core, half a node, a full node, two nodes, etc. This   can be used to exclude running at certain scales on systems that would not support it. E.g. some systems might not   support requesting multiple partial nodes, which is what the <code>1_cpn_2_nodes</code> (1 core per node, on two nodes) and   <code>1_cpn_4_nodes</code> scales do. One could exclude these by setting e.g.   <code>features: [FEATURES[CPU]] + [s for s in SCALES if s not in ['1_cpn_2_nodes', '1_cpn_4_nodes']]</code>. With this   configuration setting, ReFrame will run all the scales listed in `eessi.testsuite.constants.SCALES except   those two. In a similar way, one could exclude all multinode tests if one just has a single node available.</li> <li><code>devices</code>: This field specifies information on devices (for example) present in the partition. Device types are standardized in the EESSI test suite in the <code>eessi.testsuite.constants.DEVICE_TYPES</code> dictionary. This is used by the EESSI test suite to determine how many of these devices it can/should use per node.   Typically, there is no need to define <code>devices</code> for CPU partitions.   For GPU partitions, you want to define something like:   <pre><code>'devices': {\n    'type': DEVICE_TYPES[GPU],\n    'num_devices': 4,  # or however many GPUs you have per node\n}\n</code></pre></li> <li><code>extras</code>: This field specifies extra information on the partition, such as the GPU vendor. Valid fields for <code>extras</code> are standardized as constants in <code>eessi.testsuite.constants</code> (for example <code>GPU_VENDOR</code>). This is used by the EESSI test suite to decide if a partition can run a test that specifically requires a certain brand of GPU.   Typically, there is no need to define <code>extras</code> for CPU partitions.   For GPU partitions, you typically want to specify the GPU vendor, for example:   <pre><code>'extras': {\n    GPU_VENDOR: GPU_VENDORS[NVIDIA]\n}\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Note that as more tests are added to the EESSI test suite, the use of <code>features</code>, <code>devices</code> and <code>extras</code> by the EESSI test suite may be extended, which may require an update of your configuration file to define newly recognized fields.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Keep in mind that ReFrame partitions are virtual entities: they may or may not correspond to a partition as it is configured in your batch system. One might for example have a single partition in the batch system, but configure it as two separate partitions in the ReFrame configuration file based on additional constraints that are passed to the scheduler, see for example the AWS CitC example configuration.</p> <p>The EESSI test suite (and more generally, ReFrame) assumes the hardware within a partition defined in the ReFrame configuration file is homogeneous.</p>"},{"location":"test-suite/ReFrame-configuration-file/#environments","title":"Environments","text":"<p>ReFrame needs a programming environment to be defined in its configuration file for tests that need to be compiled before they are run.
