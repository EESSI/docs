# Deploying software

*(for maintainers)*

### Instructing the bot to deploy :rocket:

To make the [bot :robot:](../bot.md) deploy the successfully built software, you should
issue the corresponding instruction to the bot.

For more information, see the [deploying section in the bot documentation](../bot.md#deploying).

!!! warning
    Permission to trigger deployment of software installations must be granted to your GitHub account first!

    See [bot permissions](../bot.md#permissions) for more information.

### Merging the pull request

You should be able to verify in the pull request that the ingestion has been done,
since the CI should fail :x: initially to indicate that some software installations listed in
your modified easystack are missing.

Once the ingestion has been done, simply re-triggering the CI workflow should be sufficient to make it pass
:white_check_mark:, and then the pull request can be merged.

!!! note
    This assumes that the easystack file being modified is considered by the CI workflow file
    (`.github/workflows/test_eessi.yml`) that checks for missing installations, in the correct branch (for example
    `2023.06`) of the [software-layer](https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer).

    If that's not the case yet, update this workflow in your pull request as well to add the missing easystack file!

!!! warning
    You need permissions to re-trigger CI workflows and merge pull requests
    in the [software-layer](https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer) repository.

    Ask for help in the `#software-layer` channel of the EESSI Slack if needed!
