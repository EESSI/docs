f90wrap is a tool to automatically generate Python extension modules whichinterface to Fortran code that makes use of derived types. It builds on thecapabilities of the popular f2py utility by generating a simpler Fortran 90interface to the original Fortran code which is then suitable for wrapping withf2py, together with a higher-level Pythonic wrapper that makes the existance ofan additional layer transparent to the final user.
