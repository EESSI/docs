  description: SLEPc (Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations) is a software
    library for the solution of large scale sparse eigenvalue problems on parallel
    computers. It is an extension of PETSc and can be used for either standard or
    generalized eigenproblems, with real or complex arithmetic. It can also be used
    for computing a partial SVD of a large, sparse, rectangular matrix, and to solve
    quadratic eigenvalue problems.
