  description: Process Management for Exascale EnvironmentsPMI Exascale (PMIx) represents
    an attempt toprovide an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designedto
    support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overallobjective of the
    project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standarddefinitions - in fact, PMIx
    fully supports both of the existing PMI-1and PMI-2 APIs - but rather to (a) augment
    and extend those APIs toeliminate some current restrictions that impact scalability,
    and (b)provide a reference implementation of the PMI-server that demonstratesthe
    desired level of scalability.
