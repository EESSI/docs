Image Domain Gridding (IDG) is a fast method for convolutional resampling (gridding/degridding)of radio astronomical data (visibilities). Direction dependent effects (DDEs) or A-tems can be appliedin the gridding process.The algorithm is described in "Image Domain Gridding: a fast method for convolutional resampling of visibilities",Van der Tol (2018).The implementation is described in "Radio-astronomical imaging on graphics processors", Veenboer (2020).Please cite these papers in publications using IDG.
