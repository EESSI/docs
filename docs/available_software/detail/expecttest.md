    Expect tests are a method of writing tests where instead of hard-coding the expected
    output of a test, you run the test to get the output, and the test framework automatically
    populates the expected output. If the output of the test changes, you can rerun
    the test with the environment variable EXPECTTEST_ACCEPT=1 to automatically update
    the expected output.

==========


This library implements expect tests (also known as "golden" tests). Expect tests are a method of writing tests where instead of hard-coding the expected output of a test, you run the test to get the output, and the test framework automatically populates the expected output. If the output of the test changes, you can rerun the test with the environment variable EXPECTTEST_ACCEPT=1 to automatically update the expected output.
