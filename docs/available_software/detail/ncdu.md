# ncdu


Ncdu is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a
 remote server where you don't have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular
 desktop systems. Ncdu aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, and should be able to run in any minimal POSIX-like
 environment with ncurses installed.
