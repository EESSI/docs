  description: PLUMED is an open source library for free energy calculations in molecular
    systems which works together with some of the most popular molecular dynamics
    engines. Free energy calculations can be performed as a function of many order
    parameters with a particular  focus on biological problems, using state of the
    art methods such as metadynamics, umbrella sampling and Jarzynski-equation based
    steered MD. The software, written in C++, can be easily interfaced with both fortran
    and C/C++ codes.
