  description: The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent
    optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as
    some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well specified code
    representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR"). The
    LLVM Core libraries are well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent
    your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use LLVM as an optimizer and
    code generator.

# Available modules


The overview below shows which LLVM installations are available per target architecture in EESSI, ordered based on software version (new to old).

To start using LLVM, load one of these modules using a `module load` command like:

```shell
module load LLVM/16.0.6-GCCcore-13.2.0
```
