Fiona
=====


Fiona is designed to be simple and dependable. It focuses on reading and writing datain standard Python IO style and relies upon familiar Python types and protocols such as files, dictionaries,mappings, and iterators instead of classes specific to OGR. Fiona can read and write real-world data usingmulti-layered GIS formats and zipped virtual file systems and integrates readily with other Python GISpackages such as pyproj, Rtree, and Shapely.
