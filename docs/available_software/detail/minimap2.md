# minimap2


Minimap2 is a fast sequence mapping and alignment
program that can find overlaps between long noisy reads, or map long
reads or their assemblies to a reference genome optionally with detailed
alignment (i.e. CIGAR). At present, it works efficiently with query
sequences from a few kilobases to ~100 megabases in length at an error
rate ~15%. Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format. On limited
test data sets, minimap2 is over 20 times faster than most other
long-read aligners. It will replace BWA-MEM for long reads and contig
alignment.
