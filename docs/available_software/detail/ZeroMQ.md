  description: ZeroMQ looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a
    concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across
    various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can
    connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fanout, pub-sub, task distribution,
    and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its
    asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous
    message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating
    systems.
