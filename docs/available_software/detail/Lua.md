  description: Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.
    Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs
    based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed,
    runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic
    memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration,
    scripting, and rapid prototyping.

Lua
===


Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
