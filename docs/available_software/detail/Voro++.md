Voro++
======


Voro++ is a software library for carrying out three-dimensional computations of the Voronoitessellation. A distinguishing feature of the Voro++ library is that it carries out cell-based calculations,computing the Voronoi cell for each particle individually. It is particularly well-suited for applications thatrely on cell-based statistics, where features of Voronoi cells (eg. volume, centroid, number of faces) can be usedto analyze a system of particles.
