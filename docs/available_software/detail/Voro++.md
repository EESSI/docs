  description: Voro++ is a software library for carrying out three-dimensional computations
    of the Voronoitessellation. A distinguishing feature of the Voro++ library is
    that it carries out cell-based calculations,computing the Voronoi cell for each
    particle individually. It is particularly well-suited for applications thatrely
    on cell-based statistics, where features of Voronoi cells (eg. volume, centroid,
    number of faces) can be usedto analyze a system of particles.
