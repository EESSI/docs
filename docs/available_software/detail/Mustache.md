  description: Mustache (Multi-scale Detection of Chromatin Loops from Hi-C and Micro-C
    Maps usingScale-Space Representation) is a tool for multi-scale detection of chromatin
    loops from Hi-C and Micro-Ccontact maps in high resolutions (10kbp all the way
    to 500bp and even more).Mustache uses recent technical advances in scale-space
    theory inComputer Vision to detect chromatin loops caused by interaction of DNA
    segments with a variable size.
