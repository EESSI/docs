zstd
====


Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It offers a very wide range of compression/speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder. It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any sample set.
