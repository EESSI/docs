  description: The MolSSI Driver Interface (MDI) project provides a standardized API
    for fast, on-the-fly communication between computational chemistry codes. This
    greatly simplifies the process of implementing methods that require the cooperation
    of multiple software packages and enables developers to write a single implementation
    that works across many different codes. The API is sufficiently general to support
    a wide variety of techniques, including QM/MM, ab initio MD, machine learning,
    advanced sampling, and path integral MD, while also being straightforwardly extensible.
    Communication between codes is handled by the MDI Library, which enables tight
    coupling between codes using either the MPI or TCP/IP methods.

# Available modules


The overview below shows which MDI installations are available per target architecture in EESSI, ordered based on software version (new to old).

To start using MDI, load one of these modules using a `module load` command like:

```shell
module load MDI/1.4.29-gompi-2023b
```
