cimfomfa
========


This library supports both MCL, a cluster algorithm for graphs, and zoem, amacro/DSL language. It supplies abstractions for memory management, I/O,associative arrays, strings, heaps, and a few other things. The string libraryhas had heavy testing as part of zoem. Both understandably and regrettably Ichose long ago to make it C-string-compatible, hence nul bytes may not be partof a string. At some point I hope to rectify this, perhaps unrealistically.
