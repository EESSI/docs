  description: CP2K is a freely available (GPL) program, written in Fortran 95, to
    perform atomistic and molecular simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular
    and biological systems. It provides a general framework for different methods
    such as e.g. density functional theory (DFT) using a mixed Gaussian and plane
    waves approach (GPW), and classical pair and many-body potentials.
