  description: Gnu Mpc is a C library for the arithmetic of complex numbers with arbitrarily
    high precision and correct rounding of the result. It extends the principles of
    the IEEE-754 standard for fixed precision real floating point numbers to complex
    numbers, providing well-defined semantics for every operation. At the same time,
    speed of operation at high precision is a major design goal.
