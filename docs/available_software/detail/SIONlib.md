  description: SIONlib is a scalable I/O library for parallel access to task-local
    files. The library not only supports writing and reading binary data to or from
    several thousands of processors into a single or a small number of physical files,
    but also provides global open and close functions to access SIONlib files in parallel.
    This package provides a stripped-down installation of SIONlib for use with performance
    tools (e.g., Score-P), with renamed symbols to avoid conflicts when an application
    using SIONlib itself is linked against a tool requiring a different SIONlib version.

SIONlib

SIONlib is a scalable I/O library for parallel access to task-local files. The library not only supports writing and reading binary data to or from several thousands of processors into a single or a small number of physical files, but also provides global open and close functions to access SIONlib files in parallel. This package provides a stripped-down installation of SIONlib for use with performance tools (e.g., Score-P), with renamed symbols to avoid conflicts when an application using SIONlib itself is linked against a tool requiring a different SIONlib version.
