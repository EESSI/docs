  description: Osi (Open Solver Interface) provides an abstract base class to a generic
    linearprogramming (LP) solver, along with derived classes for specific solvers.
    Manyapplications may be able to use the Osi to insulate themselves from a specificLP
    solver. That is, programs written to the OSI standard may be linked to anysolver
    with an OSI interface and should produce correct results. The OSI hasbeen significantly
    extended compared to its first incarnation. Currently, theOSI supports linear
    programming solvers and has rudimentary support for integerprogramming.
