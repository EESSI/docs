Wayland
=======


Wayland is a project to define a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well as a library implementation of the protocol.  The compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client itself.  The clients can be traditional applications, X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.
