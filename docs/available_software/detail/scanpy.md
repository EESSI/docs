# scanpy


Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data built
 jointly with anndata. It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, trajectory inference
 and differential expression testing. The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with
 datasets of more than one million cells.
