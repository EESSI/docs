# Client configuration options

The EESSI repository is made available through the CernVM-FS client. We support four methods for
installing, running and configuring the CernVM-FS client on a computer:


1. [`Manual installation using a standalone package`](standalone_package.md)
2. [`Installation via the EESSI package repository`](package_repository.md)
3. [`Automated installation using a Ansible playbook`](ansible.md)
4. [`Running a fully prepared Singularity container`](singularity.md)
