# EESSI test suite

The [EESSI test suite](https://github.com/EESSI/test-suite) is a collection of tests that are run using
[ReFrame](https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/).
It is used to check whether the software installations included in the [EESSI software layer](../software_layer.md)
are working and performing as expected.

To get started, you should look into the [installation and configuration guidelines](installation-configuration.md) first.

For more information on using the EESSI test suite, see [here](usage.md).

See also [release notes for the EESSI test suite](release-notes.md).
