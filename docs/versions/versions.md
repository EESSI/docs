# EESSI Versions

EESSI is organized in different dated versions. Each EESSI version contains a version of the [compatibility layer](compatibility_layer.md) and its' own set of software applications. In addition, a particular EESSI version will target a different set of [common toolchains](https://docs.easybuild.io/common-toolchains/) to build software with. As an example, the first production EESSI version was released in June 2023 and is named `2023.06`. It contains the production release of the compatibility layer used to build software, and contains software build using the  `foss/2022b`, `foss/2023a`, and `foss/2023b` [software toolchains](https://docs.easybuild.io/common-toolchains/#common_toolchains_overview) as defined in EasyBuild. 

Going forward, we intend to have yearly EESSI version releases, which will target a different and more recent set of toolchains.
