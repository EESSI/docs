**What if you no longer have to install a broad range of scientific software from scratch on every laptop, HPC cluster, or cloud instance you use or maintain, without compromising on performance?**

The European Environment for Scientific Software Installations [EESSI](https://eessi.io) comes to the rescue!

Join us for EESSI Happy Hour, an informal, weekly online session to explore and discuss key EESSI topics and updates with the community.

Each series will focus on a specific main topic over several sessions, giving participants the opportunity to ask questions, get hands-on guidance, and share experiences.
