# What is EESSI? 

The [European Environment for Scientific Software Installations](https://www.eessi.io) (EESSI, pronounced as "easy")
is a collaboration between different European partners in the HPC (High Performance Computing) community.

EESSI provides a common stack of *optimized* scientific software installations that work on any Linux distribution,
and currently supports both `x86_64` (AMD/Intel) and `aarch64` (Arm 64-bit) systems, which is distributed
via [CernVM-FS](../cvmfs/what-is-cvmfs.md).
