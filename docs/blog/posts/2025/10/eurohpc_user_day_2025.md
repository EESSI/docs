The EuroHPC User Days 2025 in Copenhagen was a great opportunity to connect with
the HPC community and exchange ideas. The event started with a boat tour through
the harbour - a relaxed way to kick off two days of technical discussions and
networking.

## Plenary Highlights

The plenary sessions delivered important updates on:

- **EuroHPC infrastructure developments**
- **Allocation procedures and access modes**
- **The evolving role of the User Forum**
- **An outlook to emerging Quantum computing infrastructure**, including a live demo
- **Awarding the most innovative use of EuroHPC systems**

These sessions set the tone for the event, emphasizing collaboration and transparency
in the EuroHPC ecosystem.

## Parallel Sessions

Researchers, startups, and public sector teams presented impressive work across
various domains and topics such as chemical sciences and engineering, AI for
science and industry as well as quantum computing and emerging technologies.

The diversity of topics showed how EuroHPC systems are enabling breakthroughs
across disciplines.

## Software: A Key Challenge

One recurring theme was clear: **software matters**. With EuroHPC systems
becoming increasingly heterogeneous - mixing CPUs, GPUs, and specialized
accelerators - optimizing software stacks is a major challenge. Initiatives like
**EESSI** can help address this, and the upcoming **EuroHPC Federated Platform
(EFP)** offers great potential for broader adoption of the shared software stack
provided by EESSI.

## Our Contributions

We had productive discussions with site representatives from **Discoverer**,
**Deucalion**, and **JUPITER** about how EESSI and MultiXscale can support users
and administrators in making the most of advanced infrastructures. At one point,
we even "captured" an orphaned screen to present our project and explain how we
enable portability and performance across EuroHPC systems.

## AI and Quantum in Focus

AI and quantum computing were clearly in the spotlight this year, signaling where
the next big steps will be for EuroHPC and its users.

## Looking Ahead

It was a fun and insightful event - continuing the tradition from last year's User
Days ([link to previous blog post]) - and we're already looking forward to
engaging with the EuroHPC user community next year in Ireland!
